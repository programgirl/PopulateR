\title{Create a subset of observations containing only same-sex couples}
\usage{
Create.SameSexCouples(dataframe, ProbSameSex = NULL, UpWeight = FALSE,
  UpWeightProp = NULL, UpWeightLowerAge = NULL,
  UpWeightUpperAge = NULL, AgeVariableIndex = NULL,
  CoupleIDValue = NULL, HouseholdNumVariable = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{A data frame containing observations limited to one sex and includes an age column.}

\item{ProbSameSex}{The probability of any observation being assigned to a same-sex couple.}

\item{UpWeight}{If TRUE, a subset of ages will be over-sampled.}

\item{UpWeightLowerAge}{The youngest age for the over-sampling. Required if UpWeight is TRUE.}

\item{UpWeightUpperAge}{The oldest age for the over-sampling. Required if UpWeight is TRUE.}

\item{AgeVariableIndex}{The column number of the data frame that contains the ages. Only used if over-sampling is specified. Required if UpWeight is TRUE.}

\item{CoupleIDValue}{The starting number for generating a variable that identifies the observations in a couple. Must be numeric.}
}
\value{
A data frame of an even number of observations for allocation into same-sex couples.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper for randomly sampling observations into same-sex couples.
It is mainly used for data frames that contain a subset of observations that require over-sampling.
However, it can also be used to generate a simple random sample of observations.
An even number of observations is output.

\examples{
PersonDataframe <- data.frame(cbind(PersonID = c(1:1000),
                              PersonAge = c(round(runif(200, min=18, max=23),0), round(runif(300, min=24, max=50),0), round(runif(500, min=21, max=90),0))))
# create unweighted sample with no household variable
UnweightedExample <- Create.SameSexCouples(PersonDataframe, ProbSameSex=.1)
# create unweighted sample with household numbers
UnweightedExampleHouseholds <- Create.SameSexCouples(PersonDataframe, ProbSameSex=.1, CoupleIDValue=51, HouseholdNumVariable = MyHouseholdNum)
# create weighted example where 40\% of people in same-sex couples are aged between 24 and 50 years
WeightedExample <- Create.SameSexCouples(PersonDataframe, .1, .4, 24, 50, 2)
