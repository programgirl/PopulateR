## R CMD check results


## This is a resubmission

In this resubmission I have implemented a verbose option for printing to the console. For two messages, where sampling may be unexpected to the user, I have implemented warnings. All functions have been checked for the use of F and T rather than TRUE and FALSE, and changes made. I have no doi or URL additions to make to the description. I am hoping to publish a journal article on the package once it is on CRAN.

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
