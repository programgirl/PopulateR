## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the spelling errors identified in the Description.
* As a consequential result of having to resubmit, extra work has been done
 - updated a depreciated function from another package
 - added an extra example to the pairnorm function, commented out due to time duration for running both examples
 - prevented ABMToCova from outputting a schools .csv file containing zeros to show no contact. This is incompatible with the Covasim, as the person IDs start from 0 and not 1.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
