## R CMD check results

## This is a resubmission

In this resubmission I have commented out one example to reduce the time taken to run pair4betaNum to under 5 seconds. I can see there is a note below. R CMD finished with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 notes so I am unaware of what is triggering the note.

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
