### Resubmission

In this resubmission I have corrected Micro-simulation to Micro-Simulation.

Note: the R CMD results below show one note. I am not seeing the note at my end. The check shows 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 notes. I have checked the log, which also shows 1 note. Again, I can't locate what is causing the note.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
